# Credit Card Generator and Verifier

This is a Python script that generates valid credit cards using a BIN (Bank Identification Number) and verifies them using the Luhn algorithm. The script then saves the generated credit cards to a text file with the current date and time.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run the `credit_cards.py` file in your Python environment. Follow the prompts to enter the BIN code and the number of credit cards you wish to generate.

The script will then use the provided BIN to generate a set of random credit card numbers that pass the Luhn algorithm verification. The script will also generate a random expiration date and CCV number for each card.

Finally, the script will save the generated credit cards to a text file with the current date and time.
